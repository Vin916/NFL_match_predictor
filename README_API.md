# üèà NFL Predictor REST API

A Flask-based REST API that serves NFL game predictions using ensemble machine learning models.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Train and Deploy Locally

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/vinreddy/Github/NFL_match_predictor

# Run the complete deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

This will:
- Train and save the ML models
- Build the Docker image
- Start the API on http://localhost:8080

### 2. Manual Setup (Alternative)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train and save models
python3 train_and_save_model.py

# Start the Flask API
python3 app.py
```

    }
  }
}
```

### Predict from Raw Features
```bash
POST /predict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "features": [25.5, 22.1, 3.4, 18.2, 21.5, -3.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.65, 0.45, 0.2]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "prediction": 1,
  "home_win_probability": 0.68,
  "confidence": 0.68,
  "individual_votes": {
    "Logistic Regression": 1,
    "Decision Tree": 1,
    "Random Forest": 0
  }
}
```

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Build and Run
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t nfl-predictor .

# Run locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 nfl-predictor

# Run in background
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name nfl-api nfl-predictor
```

### Deploy to Google Cloud Run
```bash
# Build and push to Google Container Registry
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/nfl-predictor

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy nfl-predictor \
  --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/nfl-predictor \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 2Gi \
  --cpu 1
```

## üß™ Testing the API

### Run Test Suite
```bash
# Make sure the API is running on localhost:8080
python3 test_api.py
```

### Manual Testing with curl

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Get Teams:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/teams
```

**Predict Game:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/predict_game \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"home_team": "KC", "away_team": "BUF"}'
```

**Predict from Features:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"features": [25.5, 22.1, 3.4, 18.2, 21.5, -3.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.65, 0.45, 0.2]}'
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear probability model
- **Decision Tree**: Rule-based predictions  
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees
- **Ensemble Voting**: Combines all models for final prediction

### Features
The API uses 12 features for each prediction:
- Points scored per game (home/away/differential)
- Points allowed per game (home/away/differential)
- Home field advantage (home/away/differential)
- Win percentage (home/away/differential)

### Data Sources
- **90% weight**: Current 2025 season performance
- **10% weight**: 2024 season baseline (fallback)
- Automatically updates as more games are played

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional: Set Flask environment
export FLASK_ENV=production

# Optional: Set port (default: 5000 for Flask, 8080 for Docker)
export PORT=8080
```

### Model Artifacts
The API requires these files (generated by `train_and_save_model.py`):
- `model_logistic_regression.pkl`
- `model_decision_tree.pkl`
- `model_random_forest.pkl`
- `scaler.pkl`
- `feature_columns.pkl`

## üìä Performance

- **Training Data**: 2022-2024 NFL seasons (~1,000+ games)
- **Model Accuracy**: ~60-65% on test data
- **Response Time**: < 100ms per prediction
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB with all models loaded

## üö® Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad request (missing/invalid parameters)
- `500`: Internal server error

Error responses include descriptive messages:
```json
{
  "error": "Team not found: INVALID_TEAM"
}
```

## üîÑ Updates

To update the models with new data:
```bash
# Retrain models with latest data
python3 train_and_save_model.py

# Restart the API
docker restart nfl-api
```

## üìà Resume Bullet Point

Once deployed, you'll have a public endpoint that makes your resume bullet point 100% accurate:

> **Deployed a Flask-based REST API on Google Cloud Run to deliver win probabilities and score forecasts for live interaction.**

Your API will be accessible at: `https://nfl-predictor-xyz.a.run.app/predict_game`
